==To install the server

* Clone this repo on your machine
* In the terminal, go to the cloned directory
* Run `npm install` (without the backquotes) to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to run the server

Now you can point your browser to 'http://localhost:3000' and you should see text from a sample file.
That file lives inside the views folder and is a plain HTML file. You can write your markup right there.
Feel free to use a templating language of your choice if you prefer, but that is not required.

You will also find an assets folder where you can put your your static assets, such as CSS, Javascript and images.
Folders inside of 'assets' are mapped at the root of the server. For example, a file inside the 'assets/css' folder
may be accessed at 'http://localhost:3000/css/styles.css' and a file inside the 'assets/images' folder may be accessed
at 'http://localhost:3000/images/my-image.png'.

Feel free to delete, create or rename folders as you need.

You don't need to look into or change the server code, but if you are comfortable doing it, you are most welcome to it.
